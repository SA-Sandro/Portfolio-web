![173shots_so](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/034a6fad-bf68-46b4-9982-b013799c29d8)

A personal portfolio website where, in addition to sharing a bit about myself, I showcase the technologies I have experience with and highlight projects I've been working on.

## Features

- **Light and Dark Themes** – The portfolio supports both light and dark themes, allowing users to toggle between them for a customized viewing experience.
- **Language Switching** – Users can change the displayed language for a more accessible, international experience.
- **Persistent Settings** – The selected theme and language preferences are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they remain in place even after refreshing the page or revisiting the site.

## Technology Stack

This portfolio is built using the following technologies:

- **Astro** – Used for building the website's structure and handling static content.
- **Vue** – Adds interactivity and dynamic components to enhance user experience.
- **TypeScript** – Ensures type safety and improved code quality throughout the project.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Provides custom styling with a clean, modern design.
